I would like to focus on Sprint: Form Accessibility and Security
Milestones for this sprint include: 
Phase 1:
	Implement Radix control library
		Currently, there are two sets of components in this site.
			A: those found under the ~/app/component/* section (with the exception on the directory '/style-guide'), containing all of the controls currently used
			B: those found under the ~/app/component/style-guide/* section, containing radix controls downloaded from Figma
		Where applicable, form controls found outside of the style-guide directory should be replaced with those under the style-guide directory.

	Implement best practices for spam-bot and anti-forgery protection
		There was previously a honeypot and csrf token implementation, however, that was developed using Remix libraries. I would like to remove any dependency on Remix and keep with native React patterns, wherever possible
	Implement service that will accommodate the secure transfer of data to an external system for processing information such as Azure Application Insights and Azure Function Apps
		This service should allow for decoupling the front-end application from whatever implementation handles the processing of the data
Phase 2:
	Implement Back End system to process form data
		This will need more investigation, but my initial thoughts are:
		OnSubmit: Notify ApplicationInsights by utilizing the current architecture
		>> ApplicationInsights listens for event and alerts message queue of new entry
		>> Function app processes queue and sends email to specified administrator accounts
	* Please add suggestions here for any improvements or alterative approaches that you find applicable

Key Points of interest:
Newly developed form controls should be styled following the current pattern of using cva where appropriate (cn() found in the utilities)
Form implementation should follow the pattern set by Conform, already implemented in the site.
Form field validation should follow existing pattern using Zod 
ForwardRef functionality will need to be added to the new form controls (those found under '/components/style-guide') in compliance with Conform guidelines

After reviewing this information, please provide a document to outline these details.
Document should follow the standard site documentation format as illustrated in attached example file
