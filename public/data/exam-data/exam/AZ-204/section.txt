-----------------------------
What service would you use to collect metrics and application telemetry data to monitor application health as well as trace logging data?
Application Insights

Which Application Insights feature allows an administrator to observe activity from your deployed application in real time with no effect on the host environment?
Live Metrics

Which Application Insights feature allows an administrator to probe your applications external endpoints to test the overall availability and responsiveness over time?
Availability 

Which Application Insights feature allows an administrator to create GitHub or Azure DevOps work items in context of Application Insights data?
Github or Azure DevOps integration

Which Application Insights feature allows an administrator to understand which features are popular with users and how users interact and use your application?
Usage

Which Application Insights feature allows an administrator to automatically detect failures and other anomalies?
Smart Detection

Which Application Insights feature provides a high level top-down view of the application architecture and at-a-glance visual references to component health and responsiveness?
Application Map

Which Application Insights feature allows an administrator to search and visualize an end-to-end flow of a given execution or transaction?
Distributed Tracing

-----------------------------
Unit_03
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/3-logs-based-metrics
-----------------------------
What are the two types of metrics used in Application Insights?
Log-based metrics
Standard metrics

Which type of Application Insights metrics would you use if you were concerned with performance at query time?
Standard metrics

Which type of Application Insights metrics would you use if you wanted a superior option for datat analysis and ad-hoc diagnostics?
Log-based metrics

-----------------------------
Unit_04
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/4-app-instrumentation
-----------------------------

How do we refer to the process of enabling an application to capture telemetry?
That process is known as "Instrumenting"

What are the two methods to instrument your application into Application Insights?
Autoinstrumentation
Manual instrumentation

What are three circumstances in which you may need to use manual instrumenation by installing the Application Insights SDK into your application?
You require custom events and metrics
You require control over the flow of telemetry
Auto-instrumentation is not available, typically due to language or platform limitations

-----------------------------

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/5-availability-tests
-----------------------------
What is the maximum number of availability test allowed per Application Insights resource?
100

What type of Application Insights availability test would you use to check the availability of a site by sending a single request?
Standard test

What type of Application Insights availability test would you use to check validity of a certificate, HTTP request verb check or custom headers?
Standard test

What type of Application Insights availability test would you use if you decided to create a custom application to run availability tests?
Custom TracAvailability test

-----------------------------
Unit_06
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/6-application-map
-----------------------------
Which Application Insights feature allows you to spot performance bottlenecks or failure hotspots across all components of your distributed application?
Application Map

-----------------------------
Unit_07
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/7-knowledge-check
-----------------------------
Which availability test is recommended for authentication tests?
Custom TrackAvailability 

Which metric collection type provides near real-time querying and alerting on dimensions of metrics, and more responsive dashboards?
Preaggregated
