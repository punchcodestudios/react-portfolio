At what level are Data Storage limits set?
Data storage limits are set at the account level and not per access tier.

True

True or False: You must use all of your data storage limit in one tier and cannot cross tiers.
False

Which feature of Azure Blob Storage would you use if you needed to set up a rule-based policy that you can use to transition blob data to the appropriate access tiers or to expire data at the end of the data lifecycle.
Azure Blob Storage lifecyle management

-----------------------------
Unit_03
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-azure-blob-storage-lifecycle/3-blob-storage-lifecycle-policies
-----------------------------

What is a lifecycle management policy?
A lifecycle management policy is an array in JSON format containing between 1 and 100 defined rules.

What are the four parameters of a rule as defined in a lifecycle management policy?
name: string
enabled: boolean
type: enum
definition: object

What are the two items that each lifecycle managment policy rule must include?
Filter set
Action set

What is the purpose of a filter set in a lifecycle management rule?
The filter set limits rule actions to a certain set of objects within a container or objects names.

What is the purpose of an action set in a lifecycle management rule?
The action set applies the tier or delete actions to the filtered set of objects.

True or False: If more than one filter is defined in a lifecycle management rule, a logical AND is used for evaluation.
True

True or False: If more than one filter is defined in a lifecycle management rule, a logical OR is used for evaluation.
False

True or False: If you define more than one action on the same blob, lifecycle management applies the least expensive action to the blob.
True

True or False: If you define more than one action on the same blob, lifecycle management uses a logical AND for evaluation.
False

True or False: If you define more than one action on the same blob, lifecycle management uses a logical OR for evaluation.
False

Unit_04
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-azure-blob-storage-lifecycle/4-add-policy-blob-storage
-----------------------------
What are three ways to add a blob-storage policy through the Azure portal?

Azure Portal Code View
Azure CLI

-----------------------------
Unit_05
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-azure-blob-storage-lifecycle/5-rehydrate-blob-data
-----------------------------
What extra step must be taken in order to read or modify a blob that is in the Archive access tier?
In order to read or modify data in an archived blob, you must first rehydrate the blob to an online tier, either the hot or cool tier.

What are two ways that you can rehydrate a blob that has been archived?
Copy an archived blob to an online tier
Change a blob's access tier to an online tier

In which rehydration priority setting is the rehydration request is processed in the order it was received and might take up to 15 hours?
Standard priority

Which rehydration priority setting is the rehydration request is prioritized over standard priority requests and might complete in under one hour for objects under 10 GB in size?
High Priority

True or False: When you copy an archived blob to a new blob in an online tier, the source blob remains unmodified in the archive tier.
True
