Act as primary developer to refactor legacy Application Management System into a modern tech-stack. Application serves as the entry point for individuals applying for services eventually managed by the primary Case Management System.
•	Legacy Application Management System utilizes .NET4 Framework with C#.NET backend and leverages JavaScript/jQuery with HTML5, MVC Razor and CSS for the front-end.
•	Refactored Application Management System is a React/Typescript front end consuming a .NET8 WebAPI with EntityFramework. Front end utilizes JSX/HTML, React-Bootstrap, Mobx for state management and Axios for communication with the back end. This defines the standard architecture for future development of similar applications within the organization, currently in the planning phases.
•	As the primary developer, collaborate with Business Analysts, Project Managers and Lead Architect while analyzing, translating and communicating specific details of the legacy system to identify potential areas of improvement.
•	Provide proof of concepts for suggested enhancements focusing on performance, accessibility and user experience.
•	Work with external vendors to facilitate data transfers between systems and incorporate global authentication and authorization (OIDC) workflow into refactored application.
•	Collaborate with both internal and external Quality Assurance teams to troubleshoot and remediate issues and enhancements found during development sprints.
•	Present a demonstration of functionality for each development sprint to both internal and external stakeholders, providing transparency during the development lifecycle and establishing relationships focused on the core value of a client-first methodology.
•	This milestone project was delivered two months ahead of schedule, carrying zero defects across all development and testing sprints, with only one defect found during the post-release stabilization period.
•	The application was unique in receiving a 100% scorecard from an internal team of stakeholders evaluating compliance with internal processes and procedures.
•	Additionally, the application was unique in achieving a 100% rating by an external organization representing the end user for accomplishments in delivering a final product that met or exceeded standards for usability, performance, timeliness and overall client satisfaction.
As a member of a development team working in an Agile environment, analyze and solve issues for the primary Case Management System as reported by stakeholders and end users through JIRA ticketing
•	The primary system utilizes .NET 4 Framework with C#.NET backend and leverages JavaScript/jQuery with HTML5, Kendo UI Controls, MVC Razor and CSS for the front end. 
•	Interact with managers and peers by participating in code reviews, discussions on best practices as well as periodic meetings to evaluate opportunities for process improvements.
•	Actively participate in daily standups in accordance with SCRUM methodologies and attend regular sprint planning meetings to determine development scope and provide level of effort estimates for upcoming sprint tasks. 
•	Lead the initiative to streamline naming conventions, branching policies and check-in procedures using Git repositories, managed by Microsoft Azure, resulting in consistency between code bases, and transparency during code reviews prompted by pull requests.
•	Provide a proof-of-concept that led the initiative to incorporate Continuous Integration / Deployment via Azure DevOps services ensuring integrity and consistency throughout deployment lifecycle.

As a member of the eImagine organization, promote the core value of continuous improvement by leading initiatives that facilitate personal growth and provide opportunities for awareness to individuals outside of my immediate team.
•	Research and analyze relevant third-party tools to provide proof-of-concept for .pdf generation utility to be used across multiple applications within the organization. Utility is being integrated into current and future systems to aid in streamlining the processes relevant to .pdf generation. Proof of concept was accepted by stakeholders and development of full-featured utility led to increased revenue for the organization.
•	Create “lunch-and-learn” content demonstrating the details of the React ecosystem and present to all company team members via Microsoft Teams. This created awareness of my specific role and allowed others to gain an understanding of how this role contributes to the overall benefit of the organization.
•	Promote personal improvement by setting and accomplishing quarterly and annual goals, including obtaining certifications relevant to my professional development, transferring knowledge to other team members and adopting best practices as defined by company standards.
